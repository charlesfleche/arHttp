* Suggestion from Guillaume Laforge during the last USDrinks
** Weekend project
* Simple to build: just include -DPXR_CONFIG_CMAKE=~/opt/OpenUSD-v23.08/pxrConfig.cmake
* Purely C++ resolver as an Http resolver plugin
** Implementation in Python
* Requesting a layer can be complex
** Live extraction from a local Game Engine DB
** Resolving a Conduit Pipeline Resources Identifier
*** https://medium.com/blue-sky-tech-blog/conduit-pipeline-resource-identifiers-4432776da6ab
** Requesting the latest version of a layer from Shotgrid
* ENVAR
* Resolving sequence
* Next ?
** Custom HTTP Headers
** Contexts, not touched at all
** Caching, eTag ?
** Async resolving ?
* Existing approch from *someone else*


1. Title
2. Reminders
   - What is arResolver ?
   - Show example with files, relative paths, etc
   - C++ only
3. Show example: stage with IDs, then composed stage
4. Use cases (Extract from local Perforce Clone, Resolving PRI, Latest version from Shotgrid)
   - A resolving a layer might require many interactions with external systems
   - Can be tedious to write in C++, especially if C++ API are not available, or for rapid prototyping
   - Each client needs to collaborate / be aware of each other for local caching
   - Diagram
5. Existing approach, use *someone else* plugin to write an arResolver in python
6. Other approach: keep the resolver in C++, implement the complex logic in python, make them discuss in HTTP
   - Diagram
   - Sample python server
7. Possibility
   - Server local to a box to share layer extraction and caching for many clients
   - First time a client request a layer, the http server extract it and store locally
   - Subsequent requests from other clients will just return the path to the locally cached file
8. Configuration via ENVAR
9. Build with just PXR_CONFIG_CMAKE
10. Next ? See above
11. Conclusion / Q&A
   - PoC for now, extremely early days, no know tried this production yet
   - But still, it can be compiled and tried, it works
   - Let's discuss it on the Slack channel
